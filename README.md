# 7004-pcr-analysis 
This analysis was a laboratory project undertaken as part of my MSc Molecular Biology at Coventry University. The goal was to use RT-qPCR to test expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers following overexpression of caveolin-1 in cultured HepG2 cells and draw conclusions regarding caveolin-1's role in liver cancer progression.

The R script provided is used to analyse the PCR data and visualise the results. Raw data Ct values are not provided.

A demonstration of the PCR analysis tools described above was published by Ahmed and Kim (2018) at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5858653/
